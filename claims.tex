\subsection{Claims}
\begin{itemize} \item
Using FWRL is better than model-free learning like Q-learning in terms of generalizing to dynamic goals, static maps.
\item 
Using FWRL is better than model-based learning because of less accumulation over long term, hence more accurate value functions.
\item FWRL is better than Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) \cite{andrychowicz2016learning} because it is a parametric representation of hindsight.
\item FWRL is better than TDM~\cite{pong2018temporal} because it does not require the distance reward function.
\end{itemize}
