\section{Background}

\subsection{Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for Path-Planning}

Consider an arbitrary weighted graph, $G$, with both positive and
negative edges. Note that the algorithm does not work if negative cycles
are present. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a mechanism for finding the
shortest distances from every node to every other node in the graph. 


\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-learning is an off-policy model-free method used to learn the optimal
behaviors in any environment. 

\begin{equation}
    R_t = \sum_{t^{'}=t}^{T} \gamma^{t^{'}-t} r_{t^{'}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    Q^*(s, a) = \max_{\pi} E[R_t \mid s_t=s, a_t=a, \pi]
\end{equation}


\noindent
Which derives from the Bellman equation.
\begin{equation}
    Q^*(s, a) = E[r + \gamma \max_{a^{'}} Q^*(s^{'}, a^{'}) \mid s, a]
\end{equation}
