\subsection{Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for Path-Planning}

Consider an arbitrary weighted graph, $G = (V, E)$, with both positive and
negative edges. Note that the algorithm does not work if negative cycles
are present. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a mechanism for finding the
shortest distances from every node to every other node in the graph. 


\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-learning is an off-policy model-free method used to learn the optimal
behaviors in any environment. 

\begin{equation}
    R_t = \sum_{t^{'}=t}^{T} \gamma^{t^{'}-t} r_{t^{'}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    Q^*(s, a) = \max_{\pi} E[R_t \mid s_t=s, a_t=a, \pi]
\end{equation}


\noindent
Which derives from the Bellman equation.
\begin{equation}
    Q^*(s, a) = E[r + \gamma \max_{a^{'}} Q^*(s^{'}, a^{'}) \mid s, a]
\end{equation}

Floyd-Warshall algorithm~\citep{floydwarshall1962} is a shortest path finding
algorithm from any vertex in a graph to any other vertex in the graph.
For a weighted graph $G = (\vertices, \edges)$, Floyd-Warshall algorithm
finds the shortest path by keeping maintaining a shortest distance
data-structure $\fwds : \vertices \times \vertices \rightarrow \R$.
This data-structure represents the shortest known distance between any
two pair of vertices $i, j \in \vertices$.
The data-structure $\fwds$ is initialized with edges weights
$\fwds[i, j] \leftarrow \edges_{(i, j)} \, \forall (i, j) \in \edges$
and the uninitialized edges are assigned a high value
$\fwds[i, j] \leftarrow \infty \, \forall i, j \in \vertices$.
The algorithm works by sequentially observing all the nodes in the graph and
updating $\fwds$ as with the shortest path known so far:
%
\begin{align}
  \fwds[i, j] \leftarrow \min\{ \fwds[i, j], \fwds[i, k] + \fwds[k, j] \} \quad
  \forall i, j, k \in \vertices \, .
\end{align}%
%

The shortest path $(v_t, v_{t+1}, \dots, g)$ starting from vertex $v_t \in
\vertices$ to a goal $\goal \in \vertices$ can be read from $\fwds$ following
nearest neighbor towards minimum $\fwds$ towards the goal
%
\begin{align}
  v_{t+1} = \arg \min_{i \in \text{Nbr}(v_t)} D[i, \goal] \, ,
\end{align}%
%
where $\text{Nbr}(v_t) = \{ i | (i, v_t) \in \edges \} $ denotes the
neighborhood of $v_t$.

The update equation in the algorithm depends upon triangular inequality for
shortest paths distances ($\fwds[i, j] < \fwds[i, k] + \fwds[k, j]$) and hence
works only in the absence of negative cycles in the graph. Fortunately, many
practical problems can be formulated such that there are no negative cycles
in the graph. Although, Floyd-Warshall algorithm runs in $O(|\vertices|^3)$
and is suitable for dense graphs, there exists extensions of the algorithm
like Johnson's algorithm~\citep{johnson1977efficient} that run in
$O(|\vertices|^2\log|\vertices| + |\vertices||\edges|)$ and work on the same
principle.
