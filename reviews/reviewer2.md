Review: The paper presents an approach for an approach to addressing multi-goal reinforcement learning, based on what they call "one-step path rewards" as an alternative to the use of goal conditioned value function. 
The idea builds on an extension of a prior work on FWRL. 
The paper presents empirical comparison of the proposed method with two baselines, FWRL and HER. 
The experimental results are mixed, and do not convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness/superiority of the proposed method. 
The idea of the proposed method is relatively simple, and is not theoretically justified. 

Based on these observations, the paper falls short of the conference standard. 
Rating: 3: Clear rejection
Confidence: 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct
