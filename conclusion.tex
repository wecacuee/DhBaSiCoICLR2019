\subsection{Conclusion}
Floyd-Warshall Reinforcement Learning (FWRL) allows us to learn a goal
conditioned action-value function which is invariant to the change in goal
location as compared to the action-value function used in typical Q-learning.
This allows FWRL to transfer learned behaviors about the environment when the
goal location changes. Many tasks like navigation, robotic pick and place are
examples of goal-conditioned tasks that can benefit from this framework.
