\section{Conclusion}
Floyd-Warshall Reinforcement Learning (FWRL) allows us to learn a goal
conditioned action-value function which is invariant to the change in
goal location as compared to the action-value functions typically used
in typical Q-learning.  This allows FWRL to transfer learned behaviors
about the environment when the goal location changes. Many
goal-conditioned tasks like navigation and robotic pick and place can
benefit from this framework.
